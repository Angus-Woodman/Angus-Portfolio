      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p> My name is Angus. I am a Bristol Engineering Mathematics graduate, and have recently begun my journey to becoming a web developer. During my degree I was introduced to the world of coding by using the programming languages Matlab and python, to solve various real world problems. The satisfaction I got when completing one of these projects and having a fully functioning piece of code was huge. I knew there and then that I needed this level of satisfaction in my working life and therefore I have pursued a career in coding ever since. </p>
